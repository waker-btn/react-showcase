# React Showcase

**Work in Progress**

This project is a personal site for experimenting with and showcasing React components as I learn and explore new concepts in React and frontend development.

## Purpose

- Document and demonstrate my progress learning React
- Build a collection of interactive components and mini-apps
- Practice TypeScript, hooks, state management, and modern React patterns

## Features (so far)

- Memory Game: A simple card-matching game using hooks and state
- Tabbed Viewer: Example of tab navigation and conditional rendering
- More components coming soon!

3. Start the development server:
